A breach of this Section 5.1 shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.

If any provision of this Agreement is declared or found to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable or void, then (i) the parties to this Agreement shall be relieved of all obligations arising under such provision, but only to the extent that such provision is invalid, illegal, unenforceable or void, and this Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if that is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is valid, legal and enforceable and achieves the same objective, and (ii) the remaining provisions hereof shall be unimpaired and remain in full force and effect.

This Agreement (i) may be executed in counterparts, (ii) may be modified pursuant to Section 4 and (iii) may be waived only by a written instrument duly executed by the officers of Provider and Vendor, respectively.  Any failure by Provider at any time to enforce performance by Vendor of any provision of this Agreement shall in no way affect Provider’s rights thereafter to enforce the same, nor shall the waiver by Provider of any breach of any provision hereof be deemed to be a waiver by Provider of any other breach of the same or any other provision hereof.

Vendor acknowledges and agrees that Provider may seek consent to this Agreement by means of an electronic signature of Vendor by affirmatively clicking or checking a box or other similar means indicating acceptance to this Agreement.  If a Vendor "clicks" on such box or uses such other means, Vendor’s "click" or use of such other means will be deemed a legally binding electronic signature.  Any such acceptance is deemed to be “in writing.”  For clarity, if Vendor’s signature, agreement, consent or acknowledgment is required or requested in order to enter into the Agreement, Vendor’s “click” or use of such other means will be deemed to have the same effect as if Vendor had signed the document manually.  Vendor acknowledges and agrees that through Vendor’s “click” or use of such other means: (i) that Vendor intends to form a legally binding contract with Provider; (ii) that Vendor has read and agrees to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (iii) that Vendor agrees and intends that this Agreement be the legal equivalent of signed, written contracts, and equally binding; (iv) that by electronically agreeing to this Agreement, Vendor acknowledges that Vendor has reviewed a copy of this Agreement through the web page where this Agreement is displayed; and (v) that the individuals executing this Agreement certify that they are authorized representatives, duly authorized, including where applicable, by all necessary action to agree to this Agreement on behalf of Vendor and to bind Vendor to this Agreement.

                    19. <span class="tos_bu">Use of E-mail</span>. Vendor acknowledges that if Provider Entities use e-mail to communicate with Vendor, Provider Entities do so as an accommodation to Vendor and have no obligation whatsoever to accept instructions or cancellations via electronic mail.  Use of e-mail necessarily involves certain risks, including but not necessarily limited to those referred to below.  By using e-mail to communicate with Provider Entities’ personnel Vendor is agreeing to assume all such risks.  E-mail may not be secure, and communications through e-mail may not be confidential.  In addition, Provider assumes no responsibility to update any information communicated through e-mail.  Furthermore, even though any of Provider Entities’ personnel has communicated with Vendor through e-mail recently, such person may not (and Provider assumes no obligation to) timely see, process, act on or respond to any message from Vendor through e-mail.
