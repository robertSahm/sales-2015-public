                <h4>1. Infrastructure-As-A-Service ("IaaS") Service</h4>
                <p>Provider operates cloud infrastructure designed to enable Customer to (i) use and access instances of an operating system on hardware owned or controlled by Provider (each, a “Machine”), (ii) have connectivity between hardware owned or controlled by Provider located at 110 East 42nd Street, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10017 and 1 Churchill Place Canary Wharf London E14 5RD, and (iii) have cross-connectivity between hardware owned or controlled by Provider, located at 110 East 42nd Street, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10017 or 1 Churchill Place Canary Wharf London E14 5RD, and hardware owned or operated by the applicable Markets and/or Sources at the same location, in case of subsection (i), (ii) and (iii), solely for use by and using the Client Devices to connect to Markets and/or Sources, and provided that Customer obtains, maintains and promptly makes available to Provider any and all necessary approvals, licenses or authorizations secured by Customer from such Markets and/or Sources and subject further to Customer’s compliance with terms and conditions of the Agreement.</p>
                <h4>2. Customer Responsibilities. </h4>
                <p>Without limiting anything set forth in the Agreement and in addition thereto:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customer is solely responsible for its connectivity to the Services, for securing and maintaining approvals, licenses and authorizations for use of and access to the content of the applicable Source and/or Market and for the Sources' and Markets' fees associated with such use and access. Without limiting the foregoing and in addition thereto, Customer shall comply with generally applicable industry standards with respect to its use and access to the Services. This Service Offering IaaS Service is made part of and incorporated into the Terms and Conditions by and between Customer and Provider. In the event of any conflict between the provisions, terms or conditions of this Service Offering IaaS Service and those of said agreement, the provisions, terms or conditions of this Service Offering IaaS Service shall govern and control, and the terms of said agreement shall be modified hereby.</li>
                        <li>Customer is solely responsible for backing up any and all data, software and content it installs, sends or receives on or using Client Devices and/or Machines.</li>
                        <li>Customer shall ensure that any software, content or data it installs on the Machine and/or on the Client Devices is and remains up-to-date and patched with the latest security updates. Customer shall not introduce any malicious code or other viruses that may impact the Services. Failure to use reasonable care to protect the Machine and/or Client Devices may result in a security compromise to the Services and to Provider. A compromised Machine or Client Device including, without limitation, creating network interference may result in Customer being disconnected from the Services, including, without limitation, so as to not affect other customers. No service credits will be issued for outages resulting from disconnection due to breached Machine or Client Device security or Customer's failure to comply with any terms and conditions of the Agreement. Customer is solely responsible for any breaches of the Client Devices or Machines. Without limiting any of the rights and remedies of Provider, if a Customer breaches any of the terms and conditions of Agreement (including, without limitation, by creating a security breach for the Services), the cost to resolve any damage to any of the Services including Provider's other customers will be charged directly to Customer. Interference by Customer that may cause or is currently causing Services interruption for another customer may be disconnected immediately.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <dd>Use the Services to interfere with the use of the Services by other customers.</dd>
                        <p>Furthermore, Customer agrees that the following activities are expressly prohibited and will be deemed a breach of the Agreement:
                        </p>
                        <dt>(a)</dt>
                        <dd>unauthorized attempts by any user to gain access to any account or computer resource not belonging to the that user (example: “cracking");</dd>

                <h4>4. Provider Support.</h4>
                <p>Customer shall have the right to contact Provider for any technical issues. Provider will exercise reasonable efforts to resolve such issues to the extent such issues are under Provider's control. As part of its internal business operations, Provider monitors the availability of the servers, hardware, and software owned or controlled by Provider and on which Machine is operating. (For the avoidance of doubt, Microsoft and/or its Affiliates will not be responsible for providing any support for Services provided to you by Provider.)</p>
                <h4>5. Service Level Goal.</h4>
                <p>Provider's goal is to achieve for Customer 99.9% availability of the servers and hardware owned or controlled by Provider and on which Machine is operating, excluding downtime for emergency maintenance services, downtime for fifteen (15) minutes of routine maintenance on a daily basis and downtime caused by issues outside of Provider's control.</p>
