	<h2 class="row">History</h2>
	<p class="row">Founded in 2013, Lucera was created to fill a glaring gap in the market. Challenged by exploding market data volumes, the ongoing latency arms race, rising costs in networking and relentless new regulatory demands, we recognized that firms were hamstrung in their search for high performance infrastructure. We needed a better platform to power critical trading environments and client on-boarding, so we created Lucera. Designed and built by traders who ran High Frequency desks, Lucera delivers exceptional customer experience, performance, security and scalability in a single solution.</p>

	<p class="row">Lucera is a privately held, New York based firm launched with initial backing from Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading global financial services firm and active Lucera customer.</p>
